			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Profession:</span> Alison is a hiring manager of a medium sized software development company. Currently, Alison is actively seeking potential candidates to fill two new junior web developer positions at the company. In addition to the list of specific professional requirements, Alison was instructed to look for people with a good aesthetic/design sense that company’s team of web developers needs badly at the present.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Technology:</span> Alison uses a Windows Surface Pro (Intel Core i7; 16GB RAM; 512GB SSD; 12.3" Touchscreen 2736x1824px Display; Windows 10 Pro) at work and a Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series laptop (Intel Core i7; 16GB RAM; 17.3" 1920x1080px Display; Windows 10 Home) at home.

			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Attitudes and Behaviors:</span> Alison has five weeks to find suitable candidates for the new junior web developer positions. Ideally, she wants to prescreen potential candidates by looking at theirs professional personal websites in addition to their resumes. Since visual appeal of a personal webpage is one of Alison’s objectives, she is willing to spend an extra few minutes looking at personal web pages of potential candidates in terms both professional content and aesthetic “look and feel.”</p>

				<p><span class="wrap2">Goals:</span> </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">User Story:</span> As a user, I need to determine a few potential candidates for two junior web developer positions so I can continue evaluating them using more specific criteria. Even though this is just an initial prescreening process, both professional and aesthetic look and feel of the personal webpage is very important to me.</p>
