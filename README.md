This is a ‘Personal Website Project’ that outlines my web development education, as well as personal and professional growth. Upon completing this project, I hope to attract the attention of potential employers and/or recruiters/hiring managers and find a full-time job as a web developer.

# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Feedback
Awesome job on writing your Persona. I was able to imagine who Alison was and the frustrations she is facing looking for someone to hire. I also appreciate the styling it made reading your content a-lot easier.
