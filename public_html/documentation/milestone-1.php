			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Name:</span> Alison J. Cook</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Age:</span> 43</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Profession:</span> Alison is a hiring manager of a medium sized software development company. Currently, Alison is actively seeking potential candidates to fill two new junior web developer positions at the company. In addition to the list of specific professional requirements, Alison was instructed to look for people with a good aesthetic/design sense that company’s team of web developers needs badly at the moment.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Technology:</span> Alison uses a Windows Surface Pro (Intel Core i7; 16GB RAM; 512GB SSD; 12.3" Touchscreen 2736x1824px Display; Windows 10 Pro) at work and a Dell Inspiron 17 5000 Series laptop (Intel Core i7; 16GB RAM; 17.3" 1920x1080px Display; Windows 10 Home) at home. She also owns an  Apple iPhone 5S (iOS 7; 16GB Internal Storage; 1136x640px resolution) with an unlimited 4G data connection.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Attitudes and Behaviors:</span> Alison has five weeks to find suitable candidates for the new junior web developer positions. Ideally, she wants to prescreen potential candidates by looking at theirs professional personal websites in addition to their resumes. Since visual appeal of a personal website is one of Alison’s objectives, she is willing to spend an extra few minutes looking at personal web pages of potential candidates both in terms of professional content and aesthetic look and feel.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Frustrations and Needs:</span> Alison doesn’t like when potential candidates for open positions at her company create professional portfolio websites without spending enough time and efforts, or without using a carefully thought-out design. What frustrates Alison even more is when people present inaccurate information on their professional portfolio web pages.<br />Currently, she needs to hire two junior web developers with strong background in both front and end web development, substantial hands-on experience in modern web technologies, and who also have a good aesthetic sense.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">Goals:</span> At this stage of the hiring process, Alison wants to find a few potential candidates for junior web developer positions for the initial phone interviews. The professional and technical skills of those candidates should exactly match the job description and their professional portfolio websites must be both professionally and aesthetically appealing.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><span class="wrap2">User Story:</span> As a user, I need to determine a few potential candidates for two junior web developer positions so I can continue evaluating them using more specific criteria. Even though this is just an initial prescreening process, both professional and aesthetic look and feel of personal websites are very important to me.</p>
