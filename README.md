This is a ‘Personal Website Project’ that outlines my web development education, as well as personal and professional growth. Upon completing this project, I hope to attract the attention of potential employers and/or recruiters/hiring managers and find a full-time job as a web developer.

# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Feedback
Awesome job on writing your Persona. I was able to imagine who Alison was and the frustrations she is facing looking for someone to hire. I also appreciate the styling it made reading your content a-lot easier.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Great job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, git history, and content meet the requirements laid out in the documentation.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clean and professional looking. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish, and what your site will look like. The mobile and desktop wireframes match and are the same overall layout.
### Content Strategy
The Content Strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Because your site is not relying on overly interactivity I challenge you to make your website as clean and polished as possible with solid a color scheme and typography. (remember simple/clean is harder to accomplish than overly-complicated/bloated)

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
